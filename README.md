# ImageApp
Image App allows you to browse and search for images on Unsplash, a repository for open-license images that people can use for free.

## Instructions
Should be fairly intuitive. If it isn't, my UI is not good :)

But for clarity, one can search for images with the bar at the top, then scroll through the results below.

## Dependencies
Since this was a very limited-scope project, I included no additional dependencies like redux, mobx, axios, or enzyme. This creates some limitations which are worth noting:

- The `fetch` library is known to have some issues surrounding handling bad HTTP requests. I'd probably switch to something else in a larger scope app for the sake of that reliability.
- Very little state management: state amounts only to the images we just searched for, and it lives in the collection component
- Testing: Having `shallow` from `enzyme` helps a lot with component testing when components hook up directly to network requests. I use native testing elements for this for now
- Currently no separate component for individual collection views. If they got any more complicated than they are right now, I'd probably extract that out.

## Known issue with images
Sometimes the results for a given search are...weird.

I checked the web UI as well, and the weird results are the actual results for some searches. 

# Security
The Unsplash API requires an API key. I figured your plan to test this app would be to pull it down from github and run it, and I did not want to include the API key in a github repo.

I considered standing up a server for this app to make a request to for the API key. I set up a mocky endpoint to hand over the key, but I still felt weird about thatâ€”anyone could look at the repo, find the mocky URL, go to that URL, and get the API key.

To put the key behind authentication would have required standing up a little server instead of using Mocky. Since implementing auth didn't quite fit in the 3 hour time frame for this app,
I insteaed kept the API key in a `secrets.js` file, which I'll e-mail to Laura. To get this app to work, you'll need to insert that file at the root of the project (that is, under `ImageApp`).

IMPORTANT: The API Key only allows for 50 requests per hour. So, as fun as it is to search for images, please keep it under that so my key doesn't get revoked :)
